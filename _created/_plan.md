## Plan for Next.js Tic Tac Toe App using TypeScript

### Components to be created:
1. Board Component
   - Responsible for rendering the game board and handling user interactions.
2. Square Component
   - Represents each square in the game board.
3. Game Component
   - Manages the game state, logic, and determines the winner.
4. Index Page
   - Entry point of the application, rendering the game components.

### File Structure:
- components/
  - Board.tsx
  - Square.tsx
  - Game.tsx
- pages/
  - index.tsx

### Third Party Packages:
1. Next.js
   - Framework for building React applications with server-side rendering.
   - Installation: `npx create-next-app nextjs-tic-tac-toe --ts`
2. TypeScript
   - Typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
   - Included with Next.js template.
  
### Implementation:
1. Create Next.js app with TypeScript template.
2. Implement `Board`, `Square`, and `Game` components in separate files.
3. Add logic for rendering the game board, handling user clicks, and determining the winner.
4. Use state management in Next.js to update the game state.
5. Style the components using CSS or a CSS-in-JS library like styled-components.
6. Update the `index.tsx` file to render the game components.
7. Test the application to ensure proper functionality.
