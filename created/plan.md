## Plan for Next.js Tic Tac Toe App using TypeScript

### 1. Components to be created:
   - Board component: Responsible for rendering the game board and handling user interactions.
   - Square component: Represents a single square in the game board.
   - Game component: Manages the game state, including checking for a winner and handling the game flow.
   - App component: Main component to render the game and initialize the game state.

### 2. File Structure:
   - components/
     - Board.tsx
     - Square.tsx
     - Game.tsx
   - pages/
     - index.tsx
   - tsconfig.json

### 3. Third Party Packages:
   - Next.js: To build the React application.
     - Installation: `npx create-next-app@latest`
   - TypeScript: To add static typing to the project.
     - Installation: `npm install --save-dev typescript @types/react @types/node`
   - React: For building the user interface.
   - React-DOM: For rendering React components in the DOM.
   - @types/react: TypeScript type definitions for React.
   - @types/node: TypeScript type definitions for Node.js.
   - Other necessary packages for styling and game logic as needed.

This plan outlines the components to be created, the file structure for organizing the components, and the third-party packages required for building a Next.js Tic Tac Toe app using TypeScript.
